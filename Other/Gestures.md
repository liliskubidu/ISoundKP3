## Partition 0: MIDI Pitched instrument/“soprano”

### RightHand 
**noteOn** - Send a noteOn message when the velocity switches directions. 

**velocity** - Previous velocity can be used for noteVelocity.

**Note length, filters, etc.** - based on where you do it: x y & z directions all map to different filter envelopes.

*It’d be cool if the effect ended up looking like stirring a pot of funky sounds*

### LeftHand
**pitch: semitones** - x-axis/body relative: shoulder to arm fully extended

**pitch: octaves** - three octaves, controlled by y-axis. Above/around head is upper octave, middle octave is shoulder height, lower octave is chest area.

**Playing specific notes**

>*White piano keys (c, d, e, f, g, a, b)* - Open palm, facing camera (custom detection code required)

>*Black piano keys (c#, eb, f#, g#, bb)* - Closed fist

**Global volume** - Control with 2 fingers out (lasso) on the y-axis

## Partition 1: BEATS

To control the beats, there would be 6 presets:

L/R up, L/R mid, L/R low: activate when velocity changes from outwards to inwards

Swiping with right hand lasso switches between sets of 6 presets

## Partition 2: BASS MIDI Pitched instrument

Same controls as the 0th partition, but using a different instrument track in Ableton

## Partition 3: GRANULATOR

This is my greatest dream: 

https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/granulator/

It takes little bits of a recorded sound and loops the group of samples according to a window you can customize. ITS SO COOL AND THERE’S SO MUCH AWESOME STUFF that we can look at but here’s what I’m thinking right now:

### RightHand
Open left/right(body relative) file position

-changes the window position in the wave form that is being manipulated 

Open up/down filters/frequencies to modulate
### LeftHand
Open hand right to left (body relative) sets window size (closed hand stops window change)

changes the number of grains/samples that are looped
